# Mapping_Earthquakes
Use JavaScript's Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualizations of earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to update our earthquake map to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth, earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and out earthquake data on an extra map style!
